        <p>Enthusiastic about understanding the userâ€™s perspective I particularly enjoy working on user
            research and
            co-creation workshops. Questions regarding communities and social practices, participation and
            engagement
            as well
            as sustainability are what make me go.</p>
        <p>I want a meaningful understanding of the social contexts and based on that design matched products
            and
            services.
            For that I use methods like design thinking to dicover participants' creative potentials based on
            their own
            expertise.</p>
        <p>My approach contributes to led people engage in a development process and experience new
            opportunities. The
            imparting of knowlwedge through co-creation and exchange of knowledge encourage people for
            innovation and
            its
            implementation.</p>
