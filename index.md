Enthusiastic about understanding the userâ€™s perspective I particularly enjoy working on user research and co-creation workshops. Questions regarding communities and social practices, participation & engagement as well as sustainability are what make me go.

I want a meaningful understanding of the social contexts and based on that design matched products and services. For that I use methods like design thinking to dicover participants' creative potentials based on their own expertise. 

My approach contributes to led people engage in a development process and experience new opportunities. The imparting of knowlwedge through co-creation and exchange of knowledge encourage people for innovation and its implementation.
