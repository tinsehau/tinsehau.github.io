        <p>Enthusiastic about understanding user perspectives I particularly enjoy working on research and co-creation workshops. Inquiry regarding communities and social practices, participation and engagement, as well as sustainability, are what drives me.</p>
        <p>I want a meaningful understanding of social contexts as a means of creating products and services. To accomplish this, I use methods like design thinking to discover participants' creative potential based on their own expertise.</p>
        <p>My approach contributes to leading people in engaging the development process and experience new opportunities. The imparting and exchange of knowledge through co-creation encourage people for innovation and implementation.</p>
