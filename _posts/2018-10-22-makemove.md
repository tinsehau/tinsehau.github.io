            <h4>Challenge</h4> 
            <p>How can we promote and sustain health enhancing exercise in vocational schools?</p>
            <p>The project’s objective was to develop a ‘best practice’ model for vocational schools in order to support young adults in being more active in their daily lives, as they are predominantly being educated in sedentary work (e.g. office work). We applied and evaluated two research approaches in the creation process: A top-down approach in which the conceptual creation and integration of content were realized by an interdisciplinary team of sports and health scientists, engineers, designers, and teachers. Likewise, a bottom-up approach in which the conceptual design of the same content was developed in the framework of project work (co-creation) guided by the team.</p>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>Service Design tools and methods were used to understand the behavior of the target group. Ideas were co-created in a two-day workshop using design games and creative techniques.</p>
            <h4>Result</h4>
            <p>Based on their insights the team developed a concept for real-life interventions and set up a best practice website to guide teachers and school principals:</p>
