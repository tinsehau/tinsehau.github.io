            <h4>Why do we play?</h4> 
            <p>Apparently, human beings have a deep need for it. For babies, almost everything can be a toy. Through play, we learn, explore, interact, communicate and… have fun. Social games produce a sense of community, tradition and cohesion. By playing you enter another world, experiencing other ways to perform your identity. Often a game includes a set of rules and structures and demands their logical understanding. So what if a person is lacking this understanding?</p>
            <p>My sister Steffi was born with trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome). This is a chromosomal condition caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosomal. It causes a mental handicap and also features physiognomical characteristics. As a mental quality, you can say that they have this sincere spirit. There is a big sensitivity for creative activities like drawing or acting. General mental qualities of people with Down syndrome are their playfulness and affectionateness, along with being somewhat mischievous and imitative.</p>
            <p>Steffi is extremely introvert and does not like talking at all. It is hard for me and my family to even understand her emotions and needs. To communicate with her is always requests like “what do you want?” or to discipline her of things she is not allowed to do. I think this already restricted her in some kind in the liberty to express herself. I wanted to find a way to become more part of her world, understand more what she feels/thinks and respond to it.</p>
            <p>Playing appeared to me like a possible way to extend our communication to another level than only through language. Talking with the people in her residential care home I learnt that she refuses to play with others and mostly plays on her own. Nevertheless, I wanted to find a way of interaction and create something, either with her or at least for her.</p>
            <p>I began to introduce her to common games like memory, playing cards or pick-a-stick. She is not able to play them on their rules, so I looked at how she handled them and whether she used own rules. I analysed what she enjoys and was comfortable with. Quickly I realised her attention to order things. In the beginning, these sessions took place at her residential care home. Later we moved to my parents’ home where my presence was less confusing to her. Here her own games got into focus, like 'quips', a plugging game with different coloured stones to put in the right position within a dice, which I itself is already about ordering. I developed an extension of it, an order box I made on my own, and tested its usability with each session, to improve it.</p>  
            <p>Knowing previously that she likes to draw, I got interested to design something with her and find out how she may like to express herself through it. Her drawings consist mainly of back and forth lines in strong colours, spread over the whole paper, and partly she also emphasises the edges. Later on in the process, I recognised an inclination for folding and shredding her drawn papers. I found out that the drawings actually did not create a specific meaning to me but impressed me for the intensity and determination put into them. Trying to get more involved into her drawing and combining it with her interest in ugh ordering, I drew or printed patterns on paper and gave them to her, to see what she might do with them. For a while, she then turned to draw circles.</p>
            <p>In summary, it can be stated that working creatively and playfully with my sister became an intensive journey, not so much in terms of design research, but more by gaining mental empirical knowledge, with lots of ups and downs. The start was very successful. Steffi was very open to my attempts and for me, it was a new awareness about the life/habits of my sister. But this also affected my design research.</p>
            <p>When she denied playing/interacting with me, I instantly asked myself if I did something wrong. The fear to impair her emotional balance caused that I didn't want to force her to anything, just let her do what she wanted and scale back my design intents. Eventually, I was the one who followed her rules and not vice versa. It was more important to strengthen our relationship. The playing on weekends became a routine in our both lives. I realised that my purpose to build a “playing field” where Steffi can communicate/interact turned into a safe place she has control of. Anyway, I was impressed by the strength of her drawing works without any influence from my side. The most important point of my work was to take notice of her, her creativity, her way to play and our ability to understand – not with our mind but with our senses we have in common.</p>
