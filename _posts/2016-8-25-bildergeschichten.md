        <h4>Challenge</h4> 
        <p>How to facilitate an intercommunication between strangers from different countries, cultures and ages? How to bring them together on one table and let them talk on eye level? </p>
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>Sophie Küsswetter and I initiated in collaboration with a fugitive shelter creative workshops. The  subject was how to explore the neighbourhood and neighbours. Together with the refugees we met with fugitives, local residents and neighborhood initiatives to open a dialogue and shared thoughts and ideas. After almost every meeting we have been invited for a tea by the residents in the shelter to talk and got to know them better. Thereby they showed us photos and videos of the home and family which gave us initial spark for our project. </p>
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>Our final approach 'Bildergeschichten' is a meeting concept for refugees and neighbours to share experiences with each other. By showing personal photographs a dialogue is started that unveils much about the photographs owner. These meetings open the participants mind for asking questions and create a space in which the we get to know each other as individuals.</p>
        <p>The whole project was about the different associations and stories which are behind a photos and which give significance to the owner. We recorded the meetings and transcribed quotes of the stories that have been told intended for an analog exhibition piece which deal with these perceptions of the images.</p>
