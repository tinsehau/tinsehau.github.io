How to facilitate an intercommunication between strangers from different countries, cultures and ages? How to bring them together on one table and let them talk on eye level?

Sophie KÃ¼sswetter and I initiated in collaboration with a fugitive shelter creative workshops on the subject neighbourhood. We explored ideas with fugitives, local residents and neighborhood initiatives to open a dialogue.

Our final approach 'Bildergeschichten' is a meeting concept for refugees and neighbours to share experiences with each other. By showing personal photographs a dialogue is started that unveils much about the photographs owner. These meetings open the participants mind for asking questions and create a space in which the we get to know each other as individuals.

The whole project was about the different associations and stories which are behind a photos and which give significance to the owner. We recorded the meetings and transcribed quotes of the stories that have been told intended for an analog exhibition piece which deal with these perceptions of the images.
