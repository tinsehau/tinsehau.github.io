        <p>This work deals with the question of how the designer can design a product or a service with the aim of motivating people to act in a sustainable manner. For this, I look at different developments in the field of participatory design whose mission is to put the interest and needs of users at the center of product and service development. The participation of the user as well has become more and more determined in the design process. The states of design can better reinterpret with them and as in its full result, they turn from traditional users into co-designers. </p>
