'wir sind handdenker' was a cooperative project in which 2 design students together with the participants of a sheltered workshop create products that they themselves can produce. The participants learned about skills of a creative designing process through shared workshops and worked out their own ideas. 

The developed designs are prepared to market within the label 'be able'.
