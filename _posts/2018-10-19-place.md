        <h4>Project</h4> 
        <p>I’m born in Berlin and I have always lived here. It’s my home and my origin. In the last few years the city has changed rapidly to a place where many people from all over the world want to be. Berlin is no longer just a city; it has become a brand for a fresh, young, creative life-style. It has become a business opportunity. Neighbourhoods or ‘Kieze’ have changed, they have been gentrified. More and more the identity of these places changes. How does affect it the social framework of the Kieze?</p>
        <h4>Who belongs to a kiez? What is an authentic feeling of an urban place?</h4>
        <p>I have thought about how I traverse the city and where is important to me: the tramline M10 connects the districts of Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain and Prenzlauer Berg – districts that may be seen to represent the 'the heart of Berlin’, but the M10 is also the main artery of my daily route and routine, social life and memories of my teenage years.</p> 
        <p>Through initial walks I found a void, a waste land, that various people appeared to use recreationally – to walk the dog, to meet friends, to chat and to even grow plants and vegetables. This space didn’t appear to belong to anyone in particular, it was open and you could just walk in. There was something here that I felt I recognised, perhaps a freedom?</p> 
        <p>Through the project I have started to ask all kinds of people (both old Berliners and new) at parks, squares and voids around the M10 line about their being in these places. The conversations that have ensued seem to be a way to illicit peoples’ feelings and ideas about how we can live together in a city. Perhaps these ‘free’, public places can be seen as places to communicate, to recover and where there is a sense of affiliation. Perhaps we need to start to fully recognise the value of free space and our need for them as urban beings – spaces that are not moulded or homogenised but retain a certain rawness.</p>
        <h4>I have asked myself how I feel in one of these spaces and Do I belong her?</h4>
        <p>I have put these interviews into a digital data-map and I also did an art piece. It conveys another view of the city and something of the emotional value of a place.</p>
