        <h4>Overview</h4> 
        <p>Pigdog is a web application made to complete daily tasks, work-related, as well as leisure activities. It provides not only a neat organization system but also features to overcome procrastination and stagnation. Pigdog is an app which conveys levity, fun, and familiarity, but is still neat and clear.</p>
        <h4>Purpose and Context</h4>
        <p>This was a tutor supported, mobile app design course that allows the student to create his or her own app from beginning to end. By designing a web app I challenged myself to learn the entire UX Design process step by step. </p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>The aim was to develop a web task management application for smartphone, tablet, and desktop. Many task management apps are oriented toward a professional business level. People with difficulty motivating themselves, however, specifically require a more supportive approach. </p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Multiple methods were used in reaching the objectives of this project, but all were influenced by User-Centered Design. It started with an analysis of existing comparable apps to note the strength and weaknesses of their products. This was then followed by user research including surveys, interviews, user personas and their journeys using the app. An abundance of care was put into prototyping. First analog, then digital, as well as testing and iteration of user flow. Final designs were based on usability testing feedback, and subsequent mockups and prototypes created.</p>
        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p>Task management specifically made for procrastinators. I needed to gain deep insight and garner common ground with these kinds of people in developing a useful system for them. Aside from its primary function as a task manager, Pigdog has two main features dedicated to stopping procrastination as well as a cute puppy mascot that escorts you through your tasks.</p>
