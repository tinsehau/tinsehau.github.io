        <h4>Overview</h4> 
        <p>Pigdog is a web application made to finish off daily tasks, work-related as well as leisure activities. It provides not only a neat organization system but also features to overcome procrastination and stagnation. Pigdog is an app which conveys levity, fun, and familiarity, but is still neat and clear. </p>
        <h4>Purpose and Context</h4>
        <p>This was a tutor supported mobile app design course that allows the student to create his or her own app from beginning to end. By designing a web app I challenged myself to learn the whole UX Design process step by step.</p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>The aim was to develop a web task management application for smartphone, tablet, and desktop. A lot of task management apps are oriented on a professional business level. But especially people with difficulties to motivate themselves need a more supportive approach. </p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Multiple methods were used in reaching the objectives of this project but were all influenced by User-Centered Design. It started with an analysis of existing comparable apps to note the strength and weaknesses of the products. Then followed a user research including surveys, interviews, user personas and their journeys using the app. A lot of care was put into the prototyping, at first analog then digital, and to test and iterate the user flows. The final designs were decided based on the usability testing feedbacks. Final mockups and prototypes were created.</p>
        <h4>Challenge</h4>
        <p>A task management specifically made for procrastinators I needed to gain deep insights of these kinds of people and find common ground to develop a system useful for them. Besides the main functions of a task manager Pigdog has two main features dedicated to stopping procrastination and a cute puppy mascot that escort you through your tasks. </p>
