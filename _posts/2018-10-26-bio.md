        <h4>Purpose and Context</h4>
        <p>As part of the two-month trainee program of Accenture Interactive, a proposal for the (fictitious) organic supermarket "B-I-O" was assigned to 9 junior positions involving business, marketing, development and design. The design team, including my part, consisted of three people who were given the tasks of user research, creation of personas and journeys as well as ideation and development of a prototype.</p>
        <h4>Objective</h4>
        <p>B-I-O has 25 organic retail stores all over Germany with no online presence and wanted the roll-out of an e-commerce platform.</p>
        <h4>Approach</h4>
        <p>Our primary focus was on the evaluation of the proposal requirements, competitor research and target market determination. Customers of B-I-O shop conscious. Sustainability and environmentalism are very important to them. They wish to be informed about production sources and methods as well as engaging in a conscious living community. In essence the digital platform of B-I-O requires being more than "just" a store. It provides background information regarding distribution and facilitation of participating in community projects. With the help of user personas we carried out the customers' experience and created a prototype for a website with an integrated e-shop.</p>
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>The digital platform of B-I-O is more than a simple online store. It provides detailed distributor information alongside a dedicated section for recipes, community events and other means of participation.</p>
