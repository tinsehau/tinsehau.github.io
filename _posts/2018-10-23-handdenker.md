        <h4>Project</h4> 
        <p>'Wir sind Handdenker' was a cooperative project in which 2 design students collaborated with disabled participants in a hand bookbinding workshop. They created products to inspire new production ideas in the workshops that the participants themselves can produce. They likewise learned skills of a creative design process through shared workshops and model their own ideas.</p> 
        <h4>Process</h4>
        <p>The participants pursued their work with effort and care. Thus, all pre-existing products at the bookbindery were of very high quality. Nevertheless, there was a lot of developmental potential in terms of material, color, and shape. For three weeks the potential of the participants was explored through various workshops. These were encouraged then applied in an individual design process. The goal was to sensitize each participant to see colors and materials in relation to the form and use of the products and their consumers. There was also the difficulty in finding a common middle ground between clearly defined shop production and an experimental design process. Participants should have been able to continue their usual way of working without being torn out of their routine. At the same time, they should be empowered in their own ideas and encouraged to critically self-reflect in order to develop creative novel objects.</p>
        <h4>Result</h4>
        <p>The result was 3 handmade products of the participants. The designs were prepared to be marketed with the label 'be able'.</p>
